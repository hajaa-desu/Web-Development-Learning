Ahhh! Such a beautiful day!
The sun’s shining in a beautiful way!
Gonna take a shower, brush my teeth and-
Life is ultimately meaningless
....Uhh... (clears throat) UUHHHH

But I'll get <sub>out</sub> of the house!
Get on the road, top down, hands out!
Difficult <span class="super">Waffles</span>

<pre class="ts-font-size-adjust">
Put on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm-
The planet’s being destroyed by your carbon emissions
Oh
</pre>

<pre class="ts-font-stretch">
But I- I-, I’ll head to class!
Try my best on every test ‘til I pass!
</pre>

<p class="ts-font-indent">
And my grades are screaming in my face; Ayyyy! <br>
98 percent of what you learn is a waste
<p>

<p class="ts-text-overflow">
	I get to hang out with all my friends!
My friends are the friendliest friends!
Can't think of a better way to spend my time!
Your brain is flawed and all your friends will die
Nevermind!

I’m alive in the greatest nation! So proud of-
The exploitation of the natives
This graceful bird means freedom for all!
Tell that to the slaves, and bald eagles aren't bald

<div class="ts-word-break">
<p>I can live in the moment, milk every second!</p>
<p>At any time you could get clinical depression</p>
<p>But I'll just be happy, no matter what’s in store!</p>
<p>It’s quite genetic and we have no cure</p>
<p>Uh, at least</p>

We are young!! Not for long

It only goes downhill

Or you'll regret it
We are young!
For now
Life is fun!
For some people
We gotta make the most of it make the most of it!
Good luck... (meow!)

Woo! I got a brand new job today! (Yea!)
Doin' stuff that'll help the economy!
I'll save money and buy things at the store!
Banks can crash and capitalism is flawed
 
And it’s all because of my hard work!
And the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth
I put a lotta effort in my resume!
Good thing you don't have a black person’s name
 
I'm proud to be a functioning member of society!
Finally, I can be the citizen I dream to be!
Part of the community, contribute with my tax!
What could possibly stop me?
The shrinking middle class
AAHHHH!

I’ve at least got a nice stable job!
Until it’s outsourced to China or replaced by a robot
OH GOD- Well then I could relax a bit!
You'll be empty with nothing to distract from it
 
But man I'm a passionate graduate
I can be different and I have a career paths to pick from!
I could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky!
Neither of those will make you happy, trust me
 
I'm able to choose what I pursue!
You're a slave to people born richer than you
Then screw it, I'll keep going in
Then I'll party on the weekend and sing!
 
Thanks to autotune
 
We are young!
Not for long
Life is fun!
It only goes downhill
We gotta make the most of it, make the most of it!
Or you’ll regret it
We are young!
We still die
Life is fun!
Until you die
We gotta make the most of it, make the most of it!
Because you’ll die... (meow!)

Life is a wonder!
You’ll never know the answer
Nature is a miracle!
Natural disasters
It’s good to be alive!
You could wake up with cancer
But I'm healthy?
Healthy people still get cancer
 
I love this show!
It’s the last episode
The sun is shining!
It’s going to explode
Every species is beautiful and unique though!
Children have malaria thanks to mosquitoes
 
I met a cute girl with a ponytail!
Statistically, that relationship is going to fail
I have a wonderful family, it’s like no other!
You're not special, and one day, you'll bury your mother
(jeez dude...)
No matter what, I can find a home!
We... Will... All... Die... Alone
 
There’s amazing potential in every human on earth!
There’s no escaping the heat death of the universe
I don't have to live life based on negative parts!
No matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts!

Yeah, that’s fair
Wait, really?
Yeah, that seems reasonable
Wait-wait-wait-wait!
But you were just telling me--
Whatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want
I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying
Oh
Well in that case
 
We are young!
Life is fun!
We gotta make the most of it, make the most of it!
We are young!
Life is fun!
We gotta make the most of it, make the most of it!
 
Enjoy it while it lasts
